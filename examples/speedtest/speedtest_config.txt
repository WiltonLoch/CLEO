 * File Description:
 * configuration input parameters for CLEO to run validation of
 * collision-coalescence with e..g Golovin or Long's collision kernel.
 * Note: inital superdroplets data (xi, r0 and msol etc.)
 * read from file "initsupers_filename" is made with PYSD module
 * using python script "create_initsuperdropsbinary_script".
 * Likewise data to make gridboxmap from gridbox boundaries is
 * read from file "grid_filename" created using python
 * "create_gbxboundariesbinary_script" script.
