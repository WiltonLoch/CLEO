Motivation for CLEO
===================

In light of :ref:`such attractive properties<sdmadvatages>`, a natural 
question to raise is whether SDM can be used to model warm rain more 
accurately than conventional models. The discrepancies between bulk models 
and observations of tropical warm rain is well documented, for example 
as discussed in Schulz and Stevens 2023 :cite:`schulzstevens2023`
and vanZanten et al. 2011 :cite:`vanzanten2011`. Already SDM has been 
used to improve our understanding of how precipitation formation 
depends on small scale influences, for example the choice of turbulent 
scheme, strength of entrainment and mixing, and the CCN size and 
concentration. Such analysis uses domains with horizontal extents up to 
O(10km) and resolutions no coarser than O(100m). What remains unclear is 
the role that cloud microphysics has at larger scales, for example due to 
the interplay between precipitation and mesoscale circulations O(100km).
