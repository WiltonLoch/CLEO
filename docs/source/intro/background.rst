Background to the Super-Droplet Model (SDM)
===========================================

Cloud microphysics remains an integral and under-represented element of 
the climate system. Not only does this limit our understanding of clouds 
themselves, but also causes some of the largest uncertainties in climate 
modelling as a whole. Such a predicament is only exacerbated by Global 
Storm Resolving Models (GSRMs), the new generation of climate 
models which have storm-resolving resolutions O(1 km) and parametrise 
radiation, sub-grid turbulence, and microphysics :cite:`slingo2022`
:cite:`satoh2019` :cite:`stevens2019` :cite:`schulthess2019`. GSRMs have 
all but irradicated their parametrisations of convection, leaving 
microphysical parametrisations to replace them as one of their leading 
sources of uncertainty :cite:`morrison2019,`. State of the art climate 
models have thus accentuated the need to better understand and model 
cloud microphysics.
