Our Docs
========

.. note::
   Please consider that this project is under active development
   and our documentation is a work in progress.

We use Sphinx to build our documentation. Through the 'breathe'
extension we integrate C++ documentation created using Doxygen.

If you would like to contribute to the documentation, have questions or
would like clarification or addition to the documentation about
a particular topic, please :ref:`contact us! <contact>` or `open an
issue <https://github.com/yoctoyotta1024/CLEO/issues/new>`_ on
our GitHub repository.
